<h1>GenOffense: Generalized Offensive Language Detection Benchmark</h1>
Generalizability is the ability of machine learning models to perform consistently among different datasets.
However, there has been limited research on generalizability of offensive language detection systems.
Several popular offensive language detection datasets exists, however these datasets are annotated using different guidelines and taxonomies.
Hence it becomes difficult to combine these datasets to train and evaluate offensive language models.
To address this issue we propose GenOffense, a generalized offensive language detection benchmark.

<h2>Datasets</h2>
We use eight popular publicly available datasets containing English data to construct GenOffense.
<ul>
    <li><p>AHSD: The dataset contains data retrieved from Twitter and it was annotated using crowdsourcing.
        The annotation taxonomy contains three classes Offensive, Hate, and Neither.
        We conflate Offensive and Hate under a class OFF while the neither class corresponds to OLID’s NOT class.</p></li>
    <li><p>HASOC: This dataset used in the HASOC shared task 2020.
        It contains posts retrieved from Twitter and Facebook.
        The upper level of the annotation taxonomy used in HASOC is hate-offensive vs non Non hate-offensive, which is the same as OLID’s.
        This allows us to directly map hate-offensive to OLID’s OFF class and non hate-offensive to NOT class.</p></li>
    <li><p>HatEval: the official dataset at SemEval-2019 Task 5 (HatEval), which focuses on hate speech against migrants and women.
        The first level of annotation contains two classes, hate speech or not, which can be mapped directly to OLID’s OFF and NOT categories.</p></li>
    <li><p>HateExplain: This is a dataset collected for explainability of hate speech.
        It contains both token- and post-level annotation of Twitter and Gab posts.
        Post-level annotations have three classes; Hateful, Offensive and Normal.
        We map Hateful and Offensive classes to OFF class and Normal to NOT class.</p></li>
    <li><p>OHS: This is a dataset collected from Reddit with the goal of studying interventions in conversations containing hate speech.
        Full conversations/threads have been retrieved and annotated at the post-level as hateful or not hateful which we map to OFF and NOT classes correspondingly.</p></li>
    <li><p>OLID: This is the official dataset of the SemEval-2019 Task 6 (OffensEval).
        It contains data from Twitter annotated with a three-level hierarchical annotation which we described before.
        We adopt the labels in OLID level A as our classification labels.</p></li>
    <li><p>TCC: This is the Toxic Comment Classification dataset.
        TCC was created for the Kaggle competition with the same name.
        The dataset contains Wikipedia comments with various classes such as toxic, obscene, insult, and threat merged in the OLID OFF class.
        The rest of the instances were mapped to the NOT class.</p></li>
    <li><p>TRAC: This is the dataset used in the TRAC shared task 2020.
        It focuses on aggression detection with three classes: overtly aggressive and covertly aggressive merged as OFF and non-aggressive which corresponds to the NOT class used in OLID.
        Finally, TRAC is the most heterogeneous dataset we used in terms of data sources containing posts from Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube.</p></li>
